-- 1. Find the names of all Juniors (level = JR) who are enrolled in a class taught by Ivana Teach

-- Ivana Teach 
-- fid = '142519864'

SELECT s.sname, s.age
FROM student s
INNER JOIN enrolled e ON s.snum = e.snum
INNER JOIN class c ON e.cname = c.name
INNER JOIN faculty f ON c.fid = f.fid
WHERE f.fname like '%I%Teach'
AND s.standing = 'JR';

--2. Find the age of the oldest student who is either a History major or enrolled in a course taught by I. Teach.

SELECT MAX(age) AS max_age
FROM (
	SELECT sname, age
	FROM student s 
	WHERE s.major = 'History'
	UNION
	SELECT s.sname, s.age
	FROM student s
	INNER JOIN enrolled e ON s.snum = e.snum
	INNER JOIN class c ON e.cname = c.name
	INNER JOIN faculty f ON c.fid = f.fid
	WHERE f.fname like '%I%Teach'
	AND s.standing = 'JR'
) AS a
